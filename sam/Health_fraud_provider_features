Looking at about 70 columns/features so far.

Columns to add:
	- Number of states each provider works/serves in
		- Ready
	- Number of providers each unique beneficiary has visited
		- Ready	
	- What else?
		- Number of doctors each unique beneficiary has visited
		- Number of providers each unique doctor is listed with

Provider = provider that we're trying to judge (unique)
PotentialFraud = label from kaggle as to whether a fraud

EACH OF THESE COLUMNS BELOW WILL BE DUPLICATED FOR IN-PATIENT AND OUT-PATIENT:
	(which one do we add here?)

AttendingPhysician = number of attending physicians listed on claims with that provider as the provider
	- Would this be useful? Naturally, large providers will have many attending physicians whether fraud or not
logattnd = log of the number of patients
	- Same concern, would create an ambiguous parameter for a predictive model, since frauds can occur with only one patient or with many



For each of these range and mean metrics, it would be useful to look at a bar plot of provider distribution, colored by PotentialFraud ('hue' in sns)
- For single beneficiary providers the range metrics would be zero, the count metrics would all be one, etc. 
- This could potentially throw off a model that isn't a decision tree if the distribution of these small providers is sufficiently large
	- what is sufficient to a particular model I think we'd have to run and see. 


	(which one do we add here?)
BeneID =  number of patients on that provider's claims
logpts

meanDiagCodes = average number of diagnostic claims on that provider's claims
DiagcodesRange = the difference between the max number of diagnostic codes on claims and the minimum

meanProcCodes = average number of procedural claims on that provider's claims
ProcCodesRange = the difference between the max number of procedure codes on claims and the minimum

MeanReimburse = average reimbursement per claim for that provider
ReimburseRange = difference between max reimbursement and minimum reimbursement for claims

	(which one do we add here?)
ClaimCount = number of claims filed over the period with that provider
logClmCount = nat log of number of claims

LogClmsPerPhysician = number of cliams for provider divided by number of physicians

LogClmsPerPatnt = number of cliams for provider divided by number of patients

Not Outpatient Column(LOSRange = range between max and minimum admission days (diff btwn admit date and dischrg) for a provider)

ClmDurationRange = range between max and minimum claim days (diff btwn admit date and dischrg) for a provider

AgeRange = range from oldest patient to younges patient for a provider

AveNumChronicPerPt = average number of chronic conditions per patient
NumChronicsRange difference between max # chronic condition and minimum for provider's pts
